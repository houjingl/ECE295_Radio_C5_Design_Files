AVR interrupt checklist
1. Turn on I bit in SREG, global interrupt
2. Turn on PCIE0 interrupt enable in PCICR
(Interrupt state can be checked by polling PCIFR reg  PCIF0 bit Pin change interrupt flag 0)
3. Turn on corresponding bit in PCMSK0 Pin change mask reg 0

Note: if connecting SW5A and SW4A both to PCINT0, they need to share one single interrupt handler (Interrupt vector address 0x0008), might cause trouble

lower the address is the higher the priority level

With in the ISR, global interrupt is disabled. Write 1 to SREG to enable interrupt can be used to program nested interrupt

SW5A -> PCINT22 -> PCMSK2 ->PCIE2 (ITVEC addr 0x000A PCI2)
SW4A -> PCINT0 -> PCMSK0 ->PCIE0 (ITVEC addr 0x0008 PCI0)
